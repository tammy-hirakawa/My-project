Farm stressors are one of the main causes of farm injuries. Identifying stressful events helps to understand and find the best procedure to reduce the chance of injury. Later, the farmers can consult with health and safety specialists, and they will help give them some recommendations to diminish the risk of an injury and stay healthy. One of the most stressful events was when a farmer lost a beloved person, child, or spouse. The study aims to identify if a child or spouse's death, injury, or death is stressful. A survey with 62 life activities or events was sent to the farmers in 2004. Farmers rated them from 1 (less stressful) to 100 (more stressful). The marriage event was set as the baseline (50). In this case, marriage was considered to be neither stressful nor stress-free. If one event is more stressful than marriage, the farmer should input (51 to 100). On the other hand, if it is less stressful than marriage, the farmer could choose between 1 to 49.

# Research Questions

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item




### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

The final element.
